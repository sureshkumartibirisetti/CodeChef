**CodeChef Problem Solvers** 🧑‍💻  

🔗 [Check out my CodeChef Profile here](your-profile-link)  

Welcome to my **CodeChef repository**! This repository contains solutions to numerous problems that I've solved on **CodeChef**, a competitive programming platform. These solutions span across a wide range of difficulty levels, from beginner-friendly challenges to complex, hard-level problems. The main purpose of this repository is to help myself track my progress, document my learning journey, and share it with the community for educational purposes.

### 🚀 Problem Difficulty Breakdown:

- 🟢 **Basic** (Difficulty: 0 - 500)  
   These problems are designed to teach basic concepts of programming such as loops, conditionals, basic input/output, and simple algorithms. They are great for beginners to build their foundation in problem-solving.

- 🟡 **Easy** (Difficulty: 501 - 1000)  
   In this range, the problems become slightly more complex. They start testing your ability to implement basic algorithms like searching and sorting, and require a deeper understanding of data structures like arrays and strings.

- 🟠 **Medium** (Difficulty: 1001 - 2000)  
   These problems are designed to test your knowledge of more advanced algorithms and data structures like dynamic programming, trees, graphs, greedy algorithms, and recursion. They often require optimization to avoid brute-force solutions, helping you refine your algorithmic thinking.

- 🔴 **Hard** (Difficulty: 2000+)  
   Hard-level problems challenge even experienced programmers. They require you to solve complex algorithmic challenges and optimize solutions for large inputs. These problems often involve advanced techniques in graph theory, number theory, and advanced dynamic programming.

### 💡 **What’s Inside?**

This repository is organized by difficulty levels, with folders containing solutions to the problems in each category. The solutions are written in **C++/Java/Python** (or whatever language you prefer), and are well-commented to explain the thought process behind each approach.

Each problem contains:
- A brief description of the problem statement
- The algorithm used to solve the problem
- Code snippets with inline comments explaining how the solution works
- A section on optimization (if applicable), explaining how the brute-force solution was improved for better efficiency.

### 📈 **My Progress**

This repository is a collection of all my solutions, and I constantly update it as I solve more problems. My goal is to continuously improve my problem-solving skills and cover all topics from beginner to expert levels. I aim to solve a wide variety of problems from different domains to enhance my algorithmic and data structure knowledge.
